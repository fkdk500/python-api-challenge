This exercise has two parts Weather and vacation 
The aim of the task is to create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. The main API reference for this exercise is 
	citipy Python library Links to an external site.
	OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., 
It is expected to get effort on problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.
Weather Py
Some of the expected outputs are create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
	Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship between Weather Variables and Latitude
	Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
On Vacation PY

Create a map that displays a point for every city in thehe city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.
For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map
